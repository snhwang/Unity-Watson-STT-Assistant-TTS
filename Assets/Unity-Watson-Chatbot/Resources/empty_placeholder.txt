This file here only because github removed any folder that does not contain any files.

New WatsonSettings.asset files are created here.

There should be a menu named SNH-Watson where you can create a WatsonSettings.asset file.
There is also a menu selection that will jump to the Resources folder where WatsonSettings
should be created.
